###The hackathron take 24 hours to write an app that can be used for attracting people to indianapolis
- and I first design a python version of app
- then I use bootstrap theme to develop a mobile compatible web app with php link to the mysql database.

###The code
- I have already post the code in github 
- https://github.com/pbking1/Intro-to-indy

###The summary 
- using the bootstrap theme can minimise the work in the front end and make the development focus more on the back end logic or database.
- talking to a mentor will definitaly help you develop a better software
- read the description document carefully before coding
